## Quick start

2. npm install
3. npm run dev then open the local address it prints
4. Edit files in src/pages and src/components
5. Deploy by connecting the repo to Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, or GitHub Pages

Notes
- Global styles are in public/assets/styles/global.css
- Replace public/assets/images/portrait.jpg with a real photo
- Put your PDF resume in the project root as Braden_Queen_Resume.pdf so the header Resume button works
